- Hi, I’m @Joriito
- I'm interested in programming and love playing volleyball.
- I’m currently learning mangás, manhuas and manhwas.
- You can reach me on instagram (@joriitoo) which is the social network I use the most.
- My passion for programming is something that I came to love after participating in a programming olympics and I'm enjoying it more and more. 
- But I'm not very good and I don't know where to start studying. 
- If you can send me books, courses, videos and e-books so that I can find my way around, I would be very grateful. 
- I always try to learn more and this also serves to improve my English, which is very bad nowadays.
